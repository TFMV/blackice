# BlackIce Arrow Flight Data Server

This document describes the enhanced Arrow Flight server implementation for the BlackIce system.

## Overview

The BlackIce Flight Data Server provides a high-performance, secure, and reliable mechanism for sharing Apache Arrow RecordBatches between system components with minimal serialization overhead. It is designed to handle large volumes of telemetry data, operational metrics, and security events.

## Key Features

1. **Optimized for Arrow Data Structures**
   - Native support for Arrow's zero-copy memory model
   - Stream-based API for efficient data transfer with minimal serialization
   - Support for schema evolution and complex data types

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Optional HMAC verification for request authentication
   - Merkle tree verification for data integrity
   - Support for TLS/SSL encryption
   - Integration with BlackIce's attestation and trust verification systems

3. **Reliability and Resilience**
   - Military-grade circuit breaker implementation to prevent cascade failures
   - Batched operations for improved throughput
   - Automatic garbage collection of expired data
   - Memory usage limits and monitoring

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Configurable message size limits (up to 256MB)
   - Efficient memory management with Arrow's allocator system
   - Connection pooling and reuse
   - Optimized for both small and large record batches

5. **Operational Features**
   - Comprehensive metrics and monitoring
   - Time-to-live (TTL) for stored data
   - Admin API for runtime management
   - Graceful startup and shutdown

## Architecture

The Flight Data Server consists of several key components:

- **FlightDataServer**: Core server implementation that handles gRPC connections and Arrow Flight protocol
- **CircuitBreaker**: Prevents system overload during high-stress scenarios
- **Security Context**: Manages authentication and verification of requests
- **Memory Management**: Controls resource allocation and garbage collection

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Server

```go
config := server.FlightDataServerConfig{
    Addr:           "localhost:8991",
    Allocator:      memory.NewGoAllocator(),
    TTL:            1 * time.Hour,
    MaxMemoryBytes: 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // 1GB
    EnableGC:       true,
    GCInterval:     5 * time.Minute,
    EnableHMAC:     true,
    HMACSecretPath: "/path/to/hmac/secret",
}

flightServer, err := server.NewFlightDataServer(config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("Failed to create Flight Data Server")
}

if err := flightServer.Start(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("Failed to start Flight Data Server")
}
```

### Client Operations

The Flight Data Server supports all standard Arrow Flight operations:

- **Storing Data**: Using `DoPut` to store Arrow RecordBatches
- **Retrieving Data**: Using `DoGet` to retrieve stored batches
- **Listing Available Data**: Using `ListFlights` to enumerate stored batches
- **Custom Actions**: Using `DoAction` for operations like ping, stats, and deletion

### Admin Operations

The server supports several administrative operations through the `DoAction` API:

- **Ping**: Simple health check
- **Stats**: Get server statistics
- **GC**: Trigger manual garbage collection
- **Delete**: Delete a specific batch by ID

## Integration with BlackIce

The Flight Data Server is designed to integrate seamlessly with other BlackIce components:

1. **Telemetry System**: Store and forward telemetry data
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Share detection results across components
3. **Trust Scoring**: Enable efficient sharing of trust scores
4. **Security Operations**: Securely distribute security events

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. Enhanced authentication mechanisms
2. Support for distributed mode across multiple nodes
3. Query capabilities for filtered data retrieval
4. Integration with more BlackIce subsystems
5. Performance optimizations for specific Arrow data structures

## Conclusion

The BlackIce Flight Data Server provides a robust, secure, and high-performance solution for sharing Arrow data throughout the BlackIce ecosystem. Its focus on security, reliability, and performance makes it ideal for mission-critical applications where efficiency and data integrity are paramount.
